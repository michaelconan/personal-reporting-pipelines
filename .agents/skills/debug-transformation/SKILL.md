# Debug transformation

Diagnose and fix dlthub transformation failures. Two main failure classes: **SQL dialect incompatibility** (transformation works on dev destination, fails on production) and **pipeline state errors** (stale packages, schema drift, failed jobs).

## When to use this skill

- Transformation works on DuckDB locally but fails on BigQuery, Snowflake, or Postgres after deployment
- Pipeline fails with SQL syntax errors or "unsupported function" messages
- You want to verify SQL portability **before** deploying (proactive check)
- Pipeline is stuck in a failed/retry loop
- Columns are missing from output after the first run (NULL-only or computed/derived columns)
- You want to inspect what the transformation actually produced after a successful run

## 1. SQL dialect compatibility

### 1a. Static SQL compatibility checks

The toolkit includes a bundled dialect checker that reads your transformation file directly — no pipeline connection needed, and no script to write. It parses each `@dlt.hub.transformation` function's SQL in the dev dialect and transpiles it to the target dialect, catching portability issues before deployment.

Tell the user: *"I'm going to run a static SQL compatibility check on your transformation file to catch any SQL dialect issues before you move to prod."*

You must pass the dev and prod destination types explicitly via `--read` and `--write`. If you already have this from context (e.g. from `create-transformation`), use it directly. If not, call `get_local_pipeline_state` via MCP to retrieve the destination type for the pipeline, then ask the user for the prod destination if unknown.

Run the checker yourself and read the output:

```bash
uv run python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tools/check_dialect.py transformations/<dataset>_to_cdm.py --read <dev_dialect> --write <prod_dialect>
```

Expected output looks like:

```
Dialects: duckdb -> bigquery
Checking 5 transformation(s) from transformations/hubspot_to_cdm.py

[dim_company] OK
[dim_person] WARN: double-quoted identifier "email"; verify destination quoting in bigquery
[fact_activity] ERROR: transpile duckdb->bigquery failed: ...
...

SUMMARY
  warnings: 1
  errors: 1
```

Walk the user through the results:
- **OK** — safe to deploy as-is
- **WARN** — portability risk worth inspecting, not a guaranteed failure; common cause is double-quoted identifiers that BigQuery/Snowflake handle differently
- **ERROR** — the SQL will likely fail on the target destination; rewrite to ANSI SQL (see section 1b)
- **skipped** — SQL is dynamically constructed and can't be statically analysed; inspect those functions manually

This check catches the most common issues, but does not replace inspecting `Relation.to_sql()` output if deployment still fails after fixes:

If either dlt destination is not covered by SQLGlot, the script stops and prints the available SQLGlot dialects. In that case, inspect dlt's actual `Relation.to_sql()` output or run a target-destination test pipeline instead. SQLGlot supports 31+ dialects — see https://sqlglot.com/sqlglot.html for dialect names.

### 1b. Common dialect-specific patterns to fix

Rewrite these to ANSI SQL so SQLGlot can transpile them to any destination:

| Dialect-specific pattern | Portable ANSI alternative |
|---|---|
| `x::TEXT`, `x::INT` (cast shorthand) | `CAST(x AS VARCHAR)`, `CAST(x AS INTEGER)` |
| `IFNULL(a, b)` | `COALESCE(a, b)` |
| `ILIKE` | `LOWER(x) LIKE LOWER(y)` |
| `INT64` / `STRING` / `FLOAT64` as type names | `BIGINT` / `VARCHAR` / `DOUBLE` |
| `EPOCH_MS()`, `STRFTIME()`, `LIST_AGG()`, etc. | No ANSI equivalent — use `query_dialect` (see below) |
| `QUALIFY` clause | Wrap in subquery with `WHERE` on the window result |

### 1c. When dialect-specific SQL is unavoidable

If a transformation genuinely requires a dialect-specific function with no ANSI equivalent, declare the source dialect with `query_dialect` so SQLGlot knows how to transpile:

```python
@dlt.hub.transformation
def my_transform(dataset: dlt.Dataset):
    yield dataset(
        "SELECT STRFTIME(created_at, '%Y-%m') AS month FROM events",
        query_dialect="duckdb",  # tells dlt this SQL is DuckDB dialect
    )
```

If SQLGlot raises `UnsupportedError` or logs warnings at `unsupported_level`, the construct has no mapping to the target dialect and must be rewritten to an ANSI equivalent or handled in application code.

## 2. Pipeline failure recovery

Use this escalation order. Do not skip steps.

### Step 1: Inspect failures

```bash
uv run dlthub local pipeline failed-jobs <pipeline_name>
uv run dlthub local pipeline trace <pipeline_name>
```

Read the error messages before taking any recovery action. Most failures are fixable without touching destination state.

### Step 2: Clear stale packages

If a prior run failed mid-load and left pending packages that keep retrying old (broken) SQL:

```bash
uv run dlthub local pipeline drop-pending-packages <pipeline_name>
```

<!-- TODO: remove when dlt issue is resolved — drop-pending-packages is a workaround for stuck packages; track https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt/issues/3375 -->

Re-run after clearing. If the underlying SQL was fixed, this is often all that is needed.

### Step 3: Reconcile local state

If local pipeline state has drifted from the destination (e.g. after a partial load or schema change):

```bash
uv run dlthub local pipeline sync <pipeline_name>
```

If no recoverable destination state exists, `sync` may not resolve partial retries — use `drop-pending-packages` first.

### Step 4: Selective drop (last resort)

> **DuckDB only:** if the failure is `"Parser Error: Adding columns with constraints not yet supported"`, `dlthub local pipeline drop` will not fix it — go to section 3's DuckDB workaround instead.

Only if the steps above do not resolve the failure and incorrect schema or tables were already loaded to the destination:

```bash
uv run dlthub local pipeline drop <pipeline_name> <resource>   # drop a specific resource
uv run dlthub local pipeline drop <pipeline_name> --drop-all   # only with explicit user confirmation
```

**Safety rules before dropping:**
- Prefer dropping specific resources over `--drop-all`
- Confirm pipeline name, destination, dataset, and which resources will be dropped before executing
- `drop` removes destination tables and resets matching local state — this forces a full reload and may remove good data alongside bad
- If uncertain which resources are safe to drop, stop and ask the user before executing
- After drop: re-run transformations and validate schema/tables before further loads

## 3. Missing columns and schema issues

dlthub silently drops columns it cannot type-infer — no error, no warning. Two root causes:

### 3a. NULL-only columns

When a column is NULL-only on the first run and no `columns=` hint was provided, dlthub strips the column from the schema. Subsequent runs write data but the column is absent.

### 3b. Computed / derived columns

When a transformation uses derived expressions — `md5()`, `strftime()`, `TRY_CAST`, `CASE WHEN ... END`, aggregates with aliases, or function chains — dlthub cannot infer the output type from the SQL alone. Without a `columns=` hint the column is silently dropped.

**Diagnose:** compare expected vs actual columns using the MCP `get_table_schema` tool, or inspect via:

```bash
uv run dlthub local pipeline show <pipeline_name>
```

Identify which computed columns are absent from the output schema. Each missing column needs an explicit `columns=` hint.

**Fix:** add `columns=` hints for every affected column:

```python
@dlt.hub.transformation(
    write_disposition="replace",
    columns={
        "company_sk":   {"data_type": "text",      "nullable": False},
        "joined_at":    {"data_type": "timestamp",  "nullable": True},
        "email_hash":   {"data_type": "text",       "nullable": True},   # md5() result
        "month_bucket": {"data_type": "text",       "nullable": True},   # strftime() result
        "event_count":  {"data_type": "bigint",     "nullable": True},   # COUNT() alias
    },
)
def dim_company(dataset: dlt.Dataset):
    ...
```

`data_type` values must match the key type contract established during `create-transformation` (consistently `text` or `bigint` for surrogate keys).

Apply `columns=` hints for:
- Any column from a `LEFT JOIN` (lookup may return NULL)
- Any cast from string to typed value where the source may be empty
- Any column that was NULL-only in a prior run
- **Any computed or derived column**: `md5()`, `strftime()`, `TRY_CAST`, `CASE WHEN`, aggregate aliases, function chains

### Known DuckDB failure: "Parser Error: Adding columns with constraints not yet supported"

This error surfaces when re-running a transformation with new or modified `columns=` hints against DuckDB — DuckDB's `ALTER TABLE` cannot add constrained columns. The workaround is to drop the dataset and re-run from scratch:

```bash
# DuckDB only — this drops all tables in the dataset
duckdb <path_to_db_file> "DROP SCHEMA <dataset_name> CASCADE;"
```

Then re-run the transformation script. This is DuckDB-specific behavior and will not occur on cloud destinations (BigQuery, Snowflake, Postgres). Do not use `dlthub local pipeline drop` for this error — it does not clear the DuckDB schema and will not resolve the constraint conflict.

## 4. Validate transformation output

After fixing an issue and re-running, validate the output using the same checks as the happy path — see **`create-transformation` Step 9**.
